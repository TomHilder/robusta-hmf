# PLAN.md

## Goal

Develop `robusta-hmf`, a robust heteroskedastic matrix factorisation library in JAX. The library is being used in a paper with three example applications: a toy validation/demo, a Gaia RVS outlier identification pipeline, and a third (TBD) example demonstrating how robustness improves the delivered basis.

## Milestones

To be defined with user.
