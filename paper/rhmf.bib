  abstract = {Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is widely used for dimensionality reduction and data analysis. However, PCA results are adversely affected by outliers often observed in real-world data. Existing robust PCA methods are often computationally expensive or exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we introduce a Fast Iterative Robust (FIR) PCA method by efficiently estimating the inliers center location and covariance. Our approach leverages Incremental PCA (IPCA) to iteratively construct a subset of data points that ensures improved location and covariance estimation that effectively mitigates the influence of outliers on PCA projection. We demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy and performance compared to existing robust location and covariance methods while offering improved robustness to outlier contamination. We utilize simulated and real-world datasets to evaluate and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in identifying and preserving underlying data structures in the presence of contamination.},

  abstract = {Recent research on problem formulations based on decomposition into low-rank plus sparse matrices shows a suitable framework to separate moving objects from the background. The most representative problem formulation is the Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) solved via Principal Component Pursuit (PCP) which decomposes a data matrix in a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. However, similar robust implicit or explicit decompositions can be made in the following problem formulations: Robust Non-negative Matrix Factorization (RNMF), Robust Matrix Completion (RMC), Robust Subspace Recovery (RSR), Robust Subspace Tracking (RST) and Robust Low-Rank Minimization (RLRM). The main goal of these similar problem formulations is to obtain explicitly or implicitly a decomposition into low-rank matrix plus additive matrices. In this context, this work aims to initiate a rigorous and comprehensive review of the similar problem formulations in robust subspace learning and tracking based on decomposition into low-rank plus additive matrices for testing and ranking existing algorithms for background/foreground separation. For this, we first provide a preliminary review of the recent developments in the different problem formulations which allows us to define a unified view that we called Decomposition into Low-rank plus Additive Matrices (DLAM). Then, we examine carefully each method in each robust subspace learning/tracking frameworks with their decomposition, their loss functions, their optimization problem and their solvers. Furthermore, we investigate if incremental algorithms and real-time implementations can be achieved for background/foreground separation. Finally, experimental results on a large-scale dataset called Background Models Challenge (BMC 2012) show the comparative performance of 32 different robust subspace learning/tracking methods.},

Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the {$\ell$}1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

  abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) is a fundamental tool for analyzing multivariate data. Here the focus is on dimension reduction to the principal subspace, characterized by its projection matrix. The classical principal subspace can be strongly affected by the presence of outliers. Traditional robust approaches consider casewise outliers, that is, cases generated by an unspecified outlier distribution that differs from that of the clean cases. But there may also be cellwise outliers, which are suspicious entries that can occur anywhere in the data matrix. Another common issue is that some cells may be missing. This paper proposes a new robust PCA method, called cellPCA, that can simultaneously deal with casewise outliers, cellwise outliers, and missing cells. Its single objective function combines two robust loss functions, that together mitigate the effect of casewise and cellwise outliers. The objective function is minimized by an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm. Residual cellmaps and enhanced outlier maps are proposed for outlier detection. The casewise and cellwise influence functions of the principal subspace are derived, and its asymptotic distribution is obtained. Extensive simulations and two real data examples illustrate the performance of cellPCA.},

  abstract = {Context. Data processing constitutes a critical component of high-contrast exoplanet imaging. Its role is almost as important as the choice of a coronagraph or a wavefront control system, and it is intertwined with the chosen observing strategy. Among the data processing techniques for angular differential imaging (ADI), the most recent is the family of principal component analysis (PCA) based algorithms. It is a widely used statistical tool developed during the first half of the past century. PCA serves, in this case, as a subspace projection technique for constructing a reference point spread function (PSF) that can be subtracted from the science data for boosting the detectability of potential companions present in the data. Unfortunately, when building this reference PSF from the science data itself, PCA comes with certain limitations such as the sensitivity of the lower dimensional orthogonal subspace to non-Gaussian noise. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Aims: Inspired by recent advances in machine learning algorithms such as robust PCA, we aim to propose a localized subspace projection technique that surpasses current PCA-based post-processing algorithms in terms of the detectability of companions at near real-time speed, a quality that will be useful for future direct imaging surveys. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Methods: We used randomized low-rank approximation methods recently proposed in the machine learning literature, coupled with entry-wise thresholding to decompose an ADI image sequence locally into low-rank, sparse, and Gaussian noise components (LLSG). This local three-term decomposition separates the starlight and the associated speckle noise from the planetary signal, which mostly remains in the sparse term. We tested the performance of our new algorithm on a long ADI sequence obtained on {$\beta$} Pictoris with VLT/NACO. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: Compared to a standard PCA approach, LLSG decomposition reaches a higher signal-to-noise ratio and has an overall better performance in the receiver operating characteristic space. This three-term decomposition brings a detectability boost compared to the full-frame standard PCA approach, especially in the small inner working angle region where complex speckle noise prevents PCA from discerning true companions from noise.},

  abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, robustness, and/or speed. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis. The specific benefits of randomized techniques depend on the computational environment. Consider the model problem of finding the k dominant components of the singular value decomposition of an \$m \texttimes n\$ matrix. (i) For a dense input matrix, randomized algorithms require \$(mn (k))\$ floating-point operations (flops) in contrast to \$ (mnk)\$ for classical algorithms. (ii) For a sparse input matrix, the flop count matches classical Krylov subspace methods, but the randomized approach is more robust and can easily be reorganized to exploit multiprocessor architectures. (iii) For a matrix that is too large to fit in fast memory, the randomized techniques require only a constant number of passes over the data, as opposed to \$(k)\$ passes for classical algorithms. In fact, it is sometimes possible to perform matrix approximation with a single pass over the data.}

Besides the typical outliers, the proposed method has the unique advantage of dealing with heavy-tail-distributed data, whose covariances could be nonexistent (positively infinite, for instance). The proposed approach is also a case of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) method and adopts the robust and non-linear properties via a bounded and non-linear kernel function. The merits of the new method are illustrated by some statistical properties including the upper bound of the excess error and the behaviors of the large eigenvalues under a spiked covariance model. In addition, we show the advantages of our method over the classical PCA by a variety of simulations.

  abstract = {Matrix factorization has many applications in computer vision. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is the standard algorithm for factorization. When there are outliers and missing data, which often happen in real measurements, SVD is no longer applicable. For robustness Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) is often used for factorization by assigning a weight to each element in the measurements. Because it uses L norm, good initialization in IRLS is critical for success, but is non-trivial. In this paper, we formulate matrix factorization as a L norm minimization problem that is solved efficiently by alternative convex programming. Our formulation 1) is robust without requiring initial weighting, 2) handles missing data straightforwardly, and 3) provides a framework in which constraints and prior knowledge (if available) can be conveniently incorporated. In the experiments we apply our approach to factorization-based structure from motion. It is shown that our approach achieves better results than other approaches (including IRLS) on both synthetic and real data.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes scalable and fast algorithms for solving the Robust PCA problem, namely recovering a low-rank matrix with an unknown fraction of its entries being arbitrarily corrupted. This problem arises in many applications, such as image processing, web data ranking, and bioinformatic data analysis. It was recently shown that under surprisingly broad conditions, the Robust PCA problem can be exactly solved via convex optimization that minimizes a combination of the nuclear norm and the \$\textbackslash ell\textasciicircum 1\$-norm . In this paper, we apply the method of augmented Lagrange multipliers (ALM) to solve this convex program. As the objective function is non-smooth, we show how to extend the classical analysis of ALM to such new objective functions and prove the optimality of the proposed algorithms and characterize their convergence rate. Empirically, the proposed new algorithms can be more than five times faster than the previous state-of-the-art algorithms for Robust PCA, such as the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) algorithm. Moreover, the new algorithms achieve higher precision, yet being less storage/memory demanding. We also show that the ALM technique can be used to solve the (related but somewhat simpler) matrix completion problem and obtain rather promising results too. We further prove the necessary and sufficient condition for the inexact ALM to converge globally. Matlab code of all algorithms discussed are available at http://perception.csl.illinois.edu/matrix-rank/home.html},

Our method involves alternating between projecting appropriate residuals onto the set of low-rank matrices, and the set of sparse matrices; each projection is \textbraceleft\textbackslash em non-convex\textbraceright{} but easy to compute. In spite of this non-convexity, we establish exact recovery of the low-rank matrix, under the same conditions that are required by existing methods (which are based on convex optimization). For an \$m \textbackslash times n\$ input matrix (\$m \textbackslash leq n)\$, our method has a running time of \$O(r\textasciicircum 2mn)\$ per iteration, and needs \$O(\textbackslash log(1/\textbackslash epsilon))\$ iterations to reach an accuracy of \$\textbackslash epsilon\$. This is close to the running time of simple PCA via the power method, which requires \$O(rmn)\$ per iteration, and \$O(\textbackslash log(1/\textbackslash epsilon))\$ iterations. In contrast, existing methods for robust PCA, which are based on convex optimization, have \$O(m\textasciicircum 2n)\$ complexity per iteration, and take \$O(1/\textbackslash epsilon)\$ iterations, i.e., exponentially more iterations for the same accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real data establishes the improved speed and accuracy of our method over existing convex implementations.},

The method uses an iterative inverse-variance-weighted least-squares minimization procedure to generate a best set of basis functions. The method is similar to principal components analysis (PCA), but with the substantial advantage that it uses measurement uncertainties in a responsible way and accounts naturally for poorly measured and missing data; it models the variance in the noise-deconvolved data space. A regularization can be applied, in the form of a smoothness prior (inspired by Gaussian processes) or a non-negative constraint, without making the method prohibitively slow. Because the method optimizes a justified scalar (related to the likelihood), the basis provides a better fit to the data in a probabilistic sense than any PCA basis. We test the method on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra, concentrating on spectra known to contain two redshift components: these are spectra of gravitational lens candidates and massive black hole binaries. We apply a hypothesis test to compare one-redshift and two-redshift models for these spectra, utilizing the data-driven model trained on a random subset of all SDSS spectra. This test confirms 129 of the 131 lens candidates in our sample and all of the known binary candidates, and turns up very few false positives.},

  abstract = {The ill-posed nature of the MEG (or related EEG) source localization problem requires the incorporation of prior assumptions when choosing an appropriate solution out of an infinite set of candidates. Bayesian approaches are useful in this capacity because they allow these assumptions to be explicitly quantified using postulated prior distributions. However, the means by which these priors are chosen, as well as the estimation and inference procedures that are subsequently adopted to affect localization, have led to a daunting array of algorithms with seemingly very different properties and assumptions. From the vantage point of a simple Gaussian scale mixture model with flexible covariance components, this paper analyzes and extends several broad categories of Bayesian inference directly applicable to source localization including empirical Bayesian approaches, standard MAP estimation, and multiple variational Bayesian (VB) approximations. Theoretical properties related to convergence, global and local minima, and localization bias are analyzed and fast algorithms are derived that improve upon existing methods. This perspective leads to explicit connections between many established algorithms and suggests natural extensions for handling unknown dipole orientations, extended source configurations, correlated sources, temporal smoothness, and computational expediency. Specific imaging methods elucidated under this paradigm include the weighted minimum {$\ell$}2-norm, FOCUSS, minimum current estimation, VESTAL, sLORETA, restricted maximum likelihood, covariance component estimation, beamforming, variational Bayes, the Laplace approximation, and automatic relevance determination, as well as many others. Perhaps surprisingly, all of these methods can be formulated as particular cases of covariance component estimation using different concave regularization terms and optimization rules, making general theoretical analyses and algorithmic extensions/improvements particularly relevant.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix (the principal components) from a high-dimensional data matrix despite both small entry-wise noise and gross sparse errors. Recently, it has been shown that a convex program, named Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), can recover the low-rank matrix when the data matrix is corrupted by gross sparse errors. We further prove that the solution to a related convex program (a relaxed PCP) gives an estimate of the low-rank matrix that is simultaneously stable to small entrywise noise and robust to gross sparse errors. More precisely, our result shows that the proposed convex program recovers the low-rank matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted, with an error bound proportional to the noise level. We present simulation results to support our result and demonstrate that the new convex program accurately recovers the principal components (the low-rank matrix) under quite broad conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first result that shows the classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA), optimal for small i.i.d. noise, can be made robust to gross sparse errors; or the first that shows the newly proposed PCP can be made stable to small entry-wise perturbations.},
